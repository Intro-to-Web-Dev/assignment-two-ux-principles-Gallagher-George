            <h2>After completing the assignment...</h2>
            <p>Overall im happy with what i learned from assignment 2. After my completing my assignment and really taking a good look at the wire frames im a little displeased with the colors i chose. I also think there is a lot of wasted space if my wire frame was an actual webpage. To say the least this assignment was really good practice for me in Adobe XD and furthering my HTML/CSS skills, but i will definitely be doing a lot of thinking and making a lot of changes in overall appearance of the site. Im looking forward to learning more in class so that i cant make my site the way i actually want it to look.  </p>
